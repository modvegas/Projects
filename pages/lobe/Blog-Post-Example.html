              Today we are excited to announce a new integration with Microsoft
              Power Platform. Lobe makes machine learning simple and
              understandable. By integrating with the Power Platform, you can
              now use your machine learning models virtually anywhere in an app
              or automation flow without having to write code.
            </p>
            <p>
              With Lobe 0.10, you can now export your Lobe model to Power
              Platform and use it in Power Apps and Power Automate, enabling you
              to build no/low-code applications and automation workflows within
              minutes. This is a major step forward to solving problems with
              machine learning end-to-end. Let's dive into the details.
            </p>
            <h2>Export to Power Platform</h2>
            <p>
              Our goal is to make it easier for you to put your machine learning
              models to work. We helped makers and developers with our prior
              updates that included the GitHub starter projects and the
              <a href="#">machine learning kit</a> with Adafruit. But these
              still required some level of programming skills to finish a
              project. So, we asked ourselves, how could we make the end-to-end
              experience of building software using machine learning as easy as
              possible?
            </p>
            <p>
              This is exactly why we integrated with Power Platform, Microsoft's
              no/low-code platform to build software for businesses. You can now
              export your model to Power Platform from the Export tab in Lobe.
            </p>

                src="images/article-img1.png"
                alt="Article Inline Image"
                class="article-image"
              />
              <div class="inline-image-desc">
                You can now export your model to Power Platform
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              First click "Configure" to sign in with your work or school
              account. You can pick a name for your model and choose the
              development environment. When you export your model Lobe will
              automatically upload it to AI Builder, the home for AI models in
              Power Platform.
